```
**Warning**
Although this works, it is in early development and there may be bugs.
```
A **GraphQL KubeMQ Subscription Library for Typescript** that enables developers to communicate via [KubeMQ](https://kubemq.io/) using [KubeTS](https://github.com/yomanz/kubets).

## Install me
[NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-kubemq-subscriptions) is the best way to install this.

## Information

This package uses [KubeTS](https://npmjs.com/package/kubets) instead of the native [KubeMQ NodeJS Wrapper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kubemq-nodejs) as KubeTS is fully typed and is developed by me so I can change things to make this project better.
